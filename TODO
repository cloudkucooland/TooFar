Soon:
research using the TV source selector to OnkyoController for setting listening mode (etc?)
Report status changes from Onkyo to OnkyoController
Why doesn't adding the AirQuality sensor to the OWM device work?

Later:
Fix Kasa discovery (adding discovered devices) -- 99% done
Improve LinuxSensors to support fans and other sensors
Add Shelly discovery (once Kasa discovery is fixed)
Figure out and add support for WifiCapabilities -- requres work in HomeControl -- No good docs out there
